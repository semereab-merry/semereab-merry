# Hey, I'm Merry Z. Semereab! ☕🎨

I'm a coffee enthusiast, and  a doodler in my free time. I'm a fresh graduate from Zayed University, and I'm on a thrilling journey into the tech world, exploring the wonders of software development while sipping on my favorite brew and sketching my dreams.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning software development and the art of JavaScript.
- 🚀 I enjoy working on personal projects, turning ideas into reality.

**🎉 Fun fact:** I'm a huge fan of "Despicable Me" and those adorable Minions 🎥.
